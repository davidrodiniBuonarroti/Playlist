    <p>Look <br>
        If you had<br>
        One shot<br>
        Or one opportunity<br>
        To seize everything you ever wanted<br>
        In one moment<br>
        Would you capture it<br>
        Or just let it slip?<br>
        His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy<br>
        There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti<br>
        He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready<br>
        To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'<br>
        What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud<br>
        He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out<br>
        He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now<br>
        The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow<br>
        Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity<br>
        Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked<br>
        He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No<br>
        He won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these ropes<br>
        It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that, but he's broke<br>
        He's so stagnant, he knows, when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's<br>
        Back to the lab again, yo, this whole rhapsody<br>
        Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him<br>
        You better lose yourself in the music, the moment<br>
        You own it, you better never let it go<br>
        You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br>
        This opportunity comes once in a lifetime<br>
        You better lose yourself in the music, the moment<br>
        You own it, you better never let it go<br>
        You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br>
        This opportunity comes once in a lifetime<br>
        You better<br>
        His soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping<br>
        This world is mine for the taking<br>
        Make me king, as we move toward a New World Order<br>
        A normal life is borin', but super stardom's close to post mortem<br>
        It only grows harder, only grows hotter<br>
        He blows, it's all over, these hoes is all on him<br>
        Coast to coast shows, he's known as the Globetrotter<br>
        Lonely roads, God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father<br>
        He goes home and barely knows his own daughter<br>
        But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water<br>
        These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product<br>
        They moved on to the next schmo who flows, he nose dove and sold nada<br>
        So the soap opera is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna, but the beat goes on<br>
        Da-da-dum, da-dum, da-da<br>
        You better lose yourself in the music, the moment<br>
        You own it, you better never let it go<br>
        You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br>
        This opportunity comes once in a lifetime<br>
        You better lose yourself in the music, the moment<br>
        You own it, you better never let it go<br>
        You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br>
        This opportunity comes once in a lifetime<br>
        You better<br>
        No more games, I'ma change what you call rage<br>
        Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged<br>
        I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed<br>
        I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage<br>
        But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher<br>
        Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper<br>
        All the pain inside amplified by the<br>
        Fact that I can't get by with my nine to<br>
        Five and I can't provide the right type of<br>
        Life for my family 'cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
        And its no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer<br>
        This is my life and these times are so hard<br>
        And it's getting even harder tryna feed and water my seed, plus<br>
        Teeter totter, caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna<br>
        Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much<br>
        For me to wanna stay in one spot, another day of monotony's<br>
        Gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got<br>
        To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot<br>
        Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not<br>
        Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot<br>
        So here I go, is my shot<br>
        Feet, fail me not, this may be the only opportunity that I got<br>
        You better lose yourself in the music, the moment<br>
        You own it, you better never let it go<br>
        You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br>
        This opportunity comes once in a lifetime<br>
        You better lose yourself in the music, the moment<br>
        You own it, you better never let it go<br>
        You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br>
        This opportunity comes once in a lifetime<br>
        You better<br>
        You can do anything you set your mind to, man</p>
