    <p>Hope <br>
        Yeah, I'm on my way, I'm coming<br>
        Don't, don't lose faith in me<br>
        I know you've been waitin'<br>
        I know you've been prayin' for my soul<br>
        Hope, hope<br>
        Thirty years you been draggin' your feet<br>
        Tellin' me I'm the reason we're stagnant<br>
        Thirty years you've been claiming you're honest<br>
        And promising progress, well, where's it at?<br>
        I don't want you to feel like a failure (failure)<br>
        I know this hurts<br>
        But I gave you your chance to deliver (deliver)<br>
        Now it's my turn<br>
        Don't get me wrong, Nate, you've had a great run<br>
        But it's time to give the people somethin' different<br>
        So without further ado, I'd<br>
        Like to introduce my<br>
        (My album, my album, my album, my album, my album, my album, my album)<br>
        Hope<br>
        What's my definition of success? (Of success)<br>
        Listening to what your heart says (your heart says)<br>
        Standing up for what you know is (is)<br>
        Right, while everybody else is (is)<br>
        Tucking their tail between their legs (okay)<br>
        What's my definition of success? (Of success)<br>
        Creating something no one else can (else can)<br>
        Being brave enough to dream big (big)<br>
        Grindin' when you're told to just quit (quit)<br>
        Giving more when you got nothin' left (left)<br>
        It's a person that'll take a chance on<br>
        Something they were told could never happen<br>
        It's a person that can see the bright side through the dark times when there ain't one<br>
        It's when someone who ain't never had nothin'<br>
        Ain't afraid to walk away from more profit<br>
        'Cause they'd rather do somethin' that they really love and take the pay cut<br>
        It's a person that would never waver<br>
        Or change who they are<br>
        Just to try and gain some credibility<br>
        So they could feel accepted by a stranger<br>
        It's a person that can take the failures in their life and turn them into motivation<br>
        It's believing in yourself when no one else does, it's amazing<br>
        What a little bit of faith can do if you don't even believe in you<br>
        Why would you think or expect anybody else that's around you to?<br>
        I done did things that I regret<br>
        I done said things I can't take back<br>
        Was a lost soul at a crossroad who had no hope but I changed that<br>
        I spent years of my life holdin' on to things I never should've kept, full of hatred<br>
        Years of my life carryin' a lot of baggage that I should've walked away from<br>
        Years of my life wishin' I was someone different, lookin' for some validation<br>
        Years of my life tryna fill the void, pretending I was in<br>
        They get it<br>
        Growing pain's a necessary evil<br>
        Difficult to go through, yes, but beneficial<br>
        Some would say having a mental breakdown is a negative thing<br>
        Which on one hand, I agree with<br>
        On the other hand, it was the push I needed<br>
        To get help and start the healing process, see<br>
        If I'd have never hit rock bottom<br>
        Would I be the person that I am today?<br>
        I don't believe so<br>
        I'm a prime example of what happens when you choose to not accept defeat and face your demons<br>
        Took me thirty years to realize that if you want to get the opportunity<br>
        To be the greatest version of yourself<br>
        Sometimes you got to be someone you're not to hear the voice of reason<br>
        Having kids will make you really take a step back and look in the mirror<br>
        At least for me that's what it did, I<br>
        Wake up every day and pick my son up, hold him in my arms<br>
        And let him know he's loved (loved)<br>
        Standing by the window questioning if dad is ever going to show up (up)<br>
        Isn't something he's gon' have to worry about<br>
        Don't get it twisted, that wasn't a shot<br>
        Mama, I forgive you<br>
        I just don't want him to grow up thinkin' that he'll never be enough<br>
        Thirty years of running, thirty years of searching<br>
        Thirty years of hurting, thirty years of pain<br>
        Thirty years of fearful, thirty years of anger<br>
        Thirty years of empty, thirty years of shame<br>
        Thirty years of broken, thirty years of anguish<br>
        Thirty years of hopeless, thirty years of (hey)<br>
        Thirty years of never, thirty years of maybe<br>
        Thirty years of later, thirty years of fake<br>
        Thirty years of hollow, thirty years of sorrow<br>
        Thirty years of darkness, thirty years of (Nate)<br>
        Thirty years of baggage, thirty years of sadness<br>
        Thirty years of stagnant, thirty years of chains<br>
        Thirty years of anxious, thirty years of suffering<br>
        Thirty years of torment, thirty years of (wait)<br>
        Thirty years of bitter, thirty years of lonely<br>
        Thirty years of pushing everyone away<br>
        (You'll never evolve) I know I can change<br>
        (We are not enough) we are not the same<br>
        (You don't have the heart) you don't have the strength<br>
        (You don't have the will) you don't have the faith<br>
        (You'll never be loved) you'll never be safe<br>
        (Might as well give up) not running away<br>
        (You don't have the guts) you're the one afraid<br>
        I'm the one in charge<br>
        I'm taking the (no)<br>
        I'm taking the<br>
        Reigns</p>
